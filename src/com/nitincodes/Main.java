	/* If Give an integer N . Write a program to obtain the sum of the first and last digits of this number.
       Input
       The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.

       Output
       For each test case, display the sum of first and last digits of N in a new line.

       Constraints
       1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
